  * **Frequency** describes how many vibrations a note has a given amount of time. The more vibrations per second the higher pitch a note has. A lower frequency or lower amount of vibrations means the note is lower. For example, the note A is usually 440 vibrations per second. People often use the abbreviation Hz to signify vibrations per second which is named after the physicist who studied sound, so 440 vibrations per second = 440 Hz. 

* Whenever a note is played on an instrument or sung, there are actually more than one frequency being heard. We just call the “loudest” of these frequencies the “note” we play. The **fundamental** is the lowest frequency in that note which is usually the “main” note we perceive as the loudest. **Overtones** are the other higher frequencies that are heard along with the fundamental. 

* **Harmonics** are the integer multiples of the fundamental frequency. For example, since the note A is 440 Hz, the harmonics would be 440 Hz, 880 Hz (440 x 2), 1320 Hz (440 x 3), etc. For any fundamental frequency, f, the overtones are 1f, 2f, 3f, etc. just like the example above.

* In a perfectly shaped cylindrical tube, the overtones are exactly the same as the harmonics. However, in real instruments like a trumpet and a piano, the overtones produced by pressing a key or blowing a note are not perfect integer multiples of the fundamental. For example, on a piano, if f is the fundamental frequency, then the overtones might have the following frequencies: 1f, 2.01f, 2.02f, 3.03f, etc. Some musicians often use harmonics and overtones interchangeably even if they aren’t necessarily the same since they might be similar for a particular instrument.

* **Timbre** is what describes the unique overtones that an instrument or voice produces. For example, a clarinet has louder odd overtones (1f, 3f, 5f, 7f) while a guitar or violin might have more overtones that more accurately align with the harmonics. **Membranophones** that produce sound from a membrane have even weirder overtone series: 1f, 1.59f, 2.14f, 2.30f, 2.65f. This sequence of overtones gives each voice and instrument its own “fingerprint” and forms the basis of the unique sounds of each. Here’s the overtones produced by playing the sixth C on a piano. As the diagram shows, the loudest is the fundamental while the overtones are somewhat close to the multiples of the fundamental.

* The tuning fork spectrogram below shows that the note is much more “pure”. In other words the fundamental is significantly louder than the overtones and there aren’t as many overtones as other instruments. This is part of the reason why tuning forks are used to tune instruments.

* In normal singing, the singer puts most of the volume in the fundamental and the overtones produced are just a byproduct and contribute to the timbre for the singer. However, throat singers use a variety of techniques to “filter” out the unwanted overtones and only select one or two overtones they want to emphasize.

* Throat singers are able to produce multiple notes by singing a lower drone tone (the fundamental) around 150 Hz while also emphasizing a higher pitched note, which is an overtone. Hence the name “overtone singing” is given to this particular type of music. (Barras 62)
The throat singers use their vocal folds and tracts to filter out the unwanted overtones and emphasize overtones (Levin 84). 

* The overtone singing is also called **polyphonic** singing since there are multiple independent lines being sung at the same time.

* The art of overtone singing is also an oral tradition that is passed down from generation to generation.

* The following instruments are used in the song called *Wolf Totem*:

* **Chordophones**: - Tovshuur: 2 or 3 stringed lute: Used while storytelling and dancing.  - Morin khuur: Box-shaped Bowed fiddle.

* **Electrophone**: Amplified Bass Guitar

* **Membranophones**: - Bass Drums

* **Aerophones**: - Human voice

* At 1:58 in the video, we hear a **call and response**. After the main singer chants, the rest of the singers follow.

By bending metal and throat singing they create what they call a style they call *Hunnu Rock*, named after the Hunnu empire (known as the Huns in the West). The band still uses traditional Mongolian instruments like the “Morin Khuur (horsehead fiddle), Tovshuur (Mongolian guitar), and Tumur Khuur (jaw harp)” with more modern instruments like the bass guitar and drums."

  This is another song from the Hu band. The band was contacted by a game studio to help them produce a song for their upcoming video game based on the Star Wars franchise. Interestingly, with guidance form the studio, the band created a new alien language specifically for this song, basing the new language on aspects of Mongolian culture and also the *Eternal Blue Sky*, an ancient religion in Central Asia. Like the previous song, the band incorparated traditional throat singing and instruments with the new language and modern instruments.

  There are three main types of throat-singing in the central asia/mongolia/siberia region: kargyraa, khoomei, sygyt. Kargyraa is the lowest of the three and imitates the “growls of nighttime predators”. Sygyt produces a the higher pitched and translates to whistle since it does sound like a bird whistle. Finally khoomei (also known as xoomei) is produces the middle sound of throat singing. Somewhat confusingly, khoomei is also used as umbrella term describing all forms of throat-singing since it translates to throat (Levin 80). Kai Kozhong means songs of khoomei. This song is played by the Altai Kai, a group from the Altai republic, northwest of Mongolia."

  title : "Gender in Throat Singing"
  content : "As previously mentioned throat-singing is traditionally and still is a male-dominated field in the Mongolia/Siberia region. Although there are more women starting to learn throat-singing, the Tuvian group Tyva Kyzy is still one of the only female throat-singing groups in the world. The reason for this is somewhat cultural since there was a belief that throat singing could cause infertility for women (Levin 82). There is also a belief that throat-singing requires a great deal of physical strength (Öberg 12). Furthermore, throat-singing likely originated from herders using the singing as way to call the flock and perform rituals like the Camel Song, further limiting the amount of women learning throat-singing. Throat-singing is also an oral tradition passed down from generation to generation which is not really taught through formal education and writing. It is picked up more like a naturally acquired language (Levin 82). This means that the resources to teach others is even more limited than other forms of music since one needs to find a good teacher willing to teach. All these factors compounded likely account for why women traditionally did not learn and perform throat-singing. However, it is entirely possible for women to learn throat-singing since there is not anything “physiology unique to Turco-Mongol peoples.” According to Levin, “anybody  can, given the effort, learn to throat-sing” (82). Furthermore, in other regions, throat-singing is performed predominantly by women and not men, the reverse circumstance as the one in Mongolia/Siberia. The Inuit people in northern Canada also perform a form of throat-singing which is mainly by women. Traditionally it was performed as a game between 2 or more women while the men were away hunting or to sing to a baby (Throat Singing). Another group of people who perform throat singing is by the Xhosa people in modern day South Africa. This form of throat-singing is also performed predominantly by women showing that the art form is not just limited to a certain group of people."

  content : "Tuvan/Mongolian/Altai throat-singing has definitely become more widely known throughout the world due to the efforts of many individuals and groups. The playlist was selected in the hopes to reflect these efforts by some of the more impactful and influential artists. The Hu blends tradition and modern masterfully and hopefully appeals to some who wish a more modern take on traditional folk songs. The band was momumental in getting more people around the world exposed after being the first Mongolian band to reach No. 1 on the Hard Rock Chart on *Billboard*. Many of the songs also help to spread Mongolian culture and history through since many contain old war chants and poetry. As mentioned before, the Hu helped expose millions more people to the art through the music for the Star Wars video game since the song incorporated many aspects of Mongolian history/culture like the *Eternal Blue Sky*, an ancient religion based on shaminism and a sky diety. Songs like the one by Huun‐Huur‐Tu further exposes listeners to Mongolian history by showing the importance of horses, since even a non-native listener can hear the sounds of the horse trotting against the ground. Different regions like Altai, Mongolia, and Tuva are represented by the playlist as well to expose listeners to the slight variations between these regions. Finally, the camel song lets listeners understand the origins of throat-singing and one of the purposes it served by helping the herders in the region. "
