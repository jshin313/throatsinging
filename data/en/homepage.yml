  * **Frequency** describes how many vibrations a note has a given amount of time. The more vibrations per second the higher pitch a note has. A lower frequency or lower amount of vibrations means the note is lower. For example, the note A is usually 440 vibrations per second. People often use the abbreviation Hz to signify vibrations per second which is named after the physicist who studied sound, so 440 vibrations per second = 440 Hz. 

* Whenever a note is played on an instrument or sung, there are actually more than one frequency being heard. We just call the “loudest” of these frequencies the “note” we play. The **fundamental** is the lowest frequency in that note which is usually the “main” note we perceive as the loudest. **Overtones** are the other higher frequencies that are heard along with the fundamental. 

* **Harmonics** are the integer multiples of the fundamental frequency. For example, since the note A is 440 Hz, the harmonics would be 440 Hz, 880 Hz (440 x 2), 1320 Hz (440 x 3), etc. For any fundamental frequency, f, the overtones are 1f, 2f, 3f, etc. just like the example above.

* In a perfectly shaped cylindrical tube, the overtones are exactly the same as the harmonics. However, in real instruments like a trumpet and a piano, the overtones produced by pressing a key or blowing a note are not perfect integer multiples of the fundamental. For example, on a piano, if f is the fundamental frequency, then the overtones might have the following frequencies: 1f, 2.01f, 2.02f, 3.03f, etc. Some musicians often use harmonics and overtones interchangeably even if they aren’t necessarily the same since they might be similar for a particular instrument.

* **Timbre** is what describes the unique overtones that an instrument or voice produces. For example, a clarinet has louder odd overtones (1f, 3f, 5f, 7f) while a guitar or violin might have more overtones that more accurately align with the harmonics. **Membranophones** that produce sound from a membrane have even weirder overtone series: 1f, 1.59f, 2.14f, 2.30f, 2.65f. This sequence of overtones gives each voice and instrument its own “fingerprint” and forms the basis of the unique sounds of each. Here’s the overtones produced by playing the sixth C on a piano. As the diagram shows, the loudest is the fundamental while the overtones are somewhat close to the multiples of the fundamental.

* The tuning fork spectrogram below shows that the note is much more “pure”. In other words the fundamental is significantly louder than the overtones and there aren’t as many overtones as other instruments. This is part of the reason why tuning forks are used to tune instruments.

* In normal singing, the singer puts most of the volume in the fundamental and the overtones produced are just a byproduct and contribute to the timbre for the singer. However, throat singers use a variety of techniques to “filter” out the unwanted overtones and only select one or two overtones they want to emphasize.

* Throat singers are able to produce multiple notes by singing a lower drone tone (the fundamental) around  150 Hz while also emphasizing a higher pitched note, which is an overtone. Hence the name “overtone singing” is given to this particular type of music. (Barras 62)
The throat singers use their vocal folds and tracts to filter out the unwanted overtones and emphasize overtones (Levin 84). 

* The overtone singing is also called **polyphonic** singing since there are multiple independent lines being sung at the same time.

* The art of overtone singing is also an oral tradition that is passed down from generation to generation.

* The following instruments are used in the song called *Wolf Totem*:

* **Chordophones**: - Tovshuur: 2 or 3 stringed lute: Used while storytelling and dancing.  - Morin khuur: Box-shaped Bowed fiddle.

* **Electrophone**: Amplified Bass Guitar

* **Membranophones**: - Bass Drums

* **Aerophones**: - Human voice

* At 1:58 in the video, we hear a **call and response**. After the main singer chants, the rest of the singers follow.

  content : "The Hu is a band that is unique from the rest of the groups here since it one of the only ones that blends the traditional Mongolian throat singing with more modern day instruments and styles. By bending metal and throat singing they create what they call a style they call *Hunnu Rock*, named after the Hunnu empire (known as the Huns in the West). The band still uses traditional Mongolian instruments like the “Morin Khuur (horsehead fiddle), Tovshuur (Mongolian guitar), and Tumur Khuur (jaw harp)” with more modern instruments like the bass guitar and drums."

  This is another song from the Hu band. The band was contacted by a game studio to help them produce a song for their upcoming video game based on the Star Wars franchise. Interestingly, with guidance form the studio, the band created a new alien language specifically for this song, basing the new language on aspects of Mongolian culture and also the *Eternal Blue Sky*, an ancient religion in Central Asia. Like the previous song, the band incorparated traditional throat singing and instruments with the new language and modern instruments.

They use traditional instruments such as igil (2-stringed bowed instrument) and khomus (Tuvan jaw harp). Many of the songs incorparate important aspects of their culture, specifically by using horse imagery. In the first song, called yellow trotter, you can hear the trotting of the horse through the steady beat."
